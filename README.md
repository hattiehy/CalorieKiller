# CalorieKiller
An Android assistant for children weight management

## **Background**

Obesity and weight management for primary school aged children (5 to 12 years) is asignificant problem within Australia, with 1 in 4 children being either overweight or obese.
These children who are overweight or obese face an increased risk of both mental and physical health problems. Two of the major factors that influence whether a primary
school child is overweight are their level of physical activity and their diet. Hence, to address this, 
we have proposed an application that empowers parents to monitor and improve their children's lifestyles by focusing on diet and exercise.

## **Install**

This project uses android studio to development.(https://developer.android.com/studio/) And use for all the android system.

## **Target**

The target audience for the Calorie Killers application are the parents of primary school
children aged between 5-12 years old. Parents play an essential role in helping their
children achieve a healthier lifestyle through the development of various dietary and
activity habits. Our application intends to assist these parents in selecting healthy options
for their children, creating a foundation of a healthy lifestyle for their children going
forward.

## **Demo**
The specific code is implemented in the Calendula folder under SRC main. The home screen displays the users health record including daily recommended in take, ACE、HEIGHT、TARGET WEIGHT、BMI、and BODY CONDITION. The home screen will allow the user to enter their health data. Primarly their ACE, HEIGHT and WEIGHT. The calorie counting page allows parents to upload images of the food they or their children are about to eat and receive a calculation of the caloric content of the food. This calculation is displayed on the screen for the user, and afterwards the user can store this number in a calorie counting diary. In accordance with our focus on encouraging a healthy lifestyle for both parents and their children, the calorie counting page provides the user with the ability to track their and their children's energy intake for the day. In conjunction with our nutritional information page, the calorie counting page enables the user to determine whether or not they are consuming a healthy amount of energy on a given day. The imaging functionality makes it simple for a parent to record the food that they or their children are eating without having to scroll or type through a user interface. In addition parents can make a photographic record of their and their
children's food consumption and upload the images later. This allows parents flexibility and eliminates the need to remember minute details.

The page offers two major areas of functionality: 
###### **Photographic recognition of different foods:**
A deep learning algorithm is used to detect different types of food that are present within the images provided by the user.
###### **Calorie counting of imaged foods:**
Once the foods are identified, a calorie counting model is applied; the caloric content of the food by unit weight determined, and returned to the user.
###### **Calorie count storage:**
Once the calories of a specific food or meal are determined, they can be stored in a calorie counting diary located on the
same page.
