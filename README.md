# CalorieKiller
An Android assistant for children weight management

## **Background**

Obesity and weight management for primary school aged children (5 to 12 years) is asignificant problem within Australia, with 1 in 4 children being either overweight or obese.
These children who are overweight or obese face an increased risk of both mental and physical health problems. Two of the major factors that influence whether a primary
school child is overweight are their level of physical activity and their diet. Hence, to address this, 
we have proposed an application that empowers parents to monitor and improve their children's lifestyles by focusing on diet and exercise.

## **Install**

This project uses android studio to development.(https://developer.android.com/studio/) And use for all the android system.

## **Target**

The target audience for the Calorie Killers application are the parents of primary school
children aged between 5-12 years old. Parents play an essential role in helping their
children achieve a healthier lifestyle through the development of various dietary and
activity habits. Our application intends to assist these parents in selecting healthy options
for their children, creating a foundation of a healthy lifestyle for their children going
forward.
